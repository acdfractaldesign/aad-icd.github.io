                    The first inspiration of the geoemtry was the fractal geometry koch curve and in the following the strcuture was generated
                    through a recusive function. Fot the interaction between user and geoemtry, a slider interface display allows to clone the structure
                    in a z direction. The geoemtry dimension is adjustable, by changing the the max_iterations value. This value refers to the
                    maximal count of iterations until the recursion will stop calling itself. Two different angle parameters are linked to the definition
                    of the vector for defining the base geometry. When changing the translate.z value the app user has the chance to work with a
                    treedimensional geometry. The amount.paramter let the user generate clones of the structure in z direction and the move_z
                    slider defines the distance in which the geometry moves. The code itself is structured in five definitons, that are iterated as long
                    as the maximal number of iterations is not reached. First the design definition calls functions and is integrated in the main, the
                    system defintion defines the recursive, that recalls as long as the maximum of iterations is not reached. In the following the
                    generate() function contains the defintion of different symbols. The draw_function finally generates the spheres and lines.
