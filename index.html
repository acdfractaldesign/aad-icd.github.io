                    The app Shevilion is made for architects, structural engineers, designers and everyone else, who is interested in structural design. The main goal of this app is to work as a design tool for early process stages. Imagine you have a shape in mind, but don't know how the structure could look like. This tool will help you evaluating different structural approaches for your shape and makes generative design tools accessible for everyone.
                    <p></p>
                    In terms of further development and integration in bigger contextes and challenges, the app wants to contribute in material optimization processes, specifically for shell constructions. For that purpose attractor points are integrated at different points on the shell that produce in a normal deviation points based on density and size values of each attractor. The developers aim would be, that by linking the app to a parametric engineering program like Â© Karamba3D 2022 and adding material properties and crosssections to the lines and performing structural analysis, the user gets the chance to optimize his structure and design more ressource efficiently. The final goal would be to integrate the tool in workflows for additive manufacturing processes.

                   <p>The attractors of the shell are positioned at thh edge points of the shell, in the middle and bewtween middle and edge. Based on these three locations each of the attractors has a  different density and size value. By changing the size value the user can 
                   actively control the material placement of every attractor zone. </p>
