                     The app Shevilion is made for architects, structural engineers, designers and everyone else, who is interested in structural design. The main goal of this app is to work as a design tool for early process stages.
		     Imagine you have a shape in mind, but don't know how the structure could look like. This tool will help you evaluating different structural approaches for your shape and makes generative design accessible for everyone.
		     
		     In terms of further development and integration in bigger contextes and challenges, the app wants to contribute in
		     material optimization processes, specifically for shell constructions. For that purpose attractors are inegrated that produce in a normal deviation points based on density and size values, that differ
		     for specific regions of the shell. The developers aim would be, that by linking the app to a parametric engineering program like Â© Karamba3D 2022 and adding material properties and 
		     crosssections to the lines and performing structural analysis, the user gets the chance to optimize his structure and design more ressource efficient. Finally, this app could be integrated in additive manufacturing processes.
