                    The app Shevilion is made for architects and everyone else, who is interested in structural design. The main goal of this application is to work as a tool, that supports designers in early process stages. 
                    Shevillion is made for first simple studies before stepping further in the structural design of geometries. 

                    The reason for an architect to use the app is that he has an idea of a shape in his mind but doesn't know how to structurally define his geometry. Therefore, this tool will help the user 
                    to evaluate different structural approaches for his design. 
                    </p>
                    For using the app, the designer modifies in a fist step a Nurbssurface with control points and shapes the base geometry to let it become suitable for his architectural problem. After finding the desired starting base, the user can start playing around with different 
                    solutions, the app provides for creating a structure. The fractal generation part allows to discover more treelike structures and organic patterns. This structures are influenced by the user when he defines the branch lenght which is linked to the maximum iterations of a recursive function for creating the fractal. 
                    A further approach supports the creation of a gridstructure, where the stepsize of two walkers can be changed to create a wider or denser grid. In a final step the user removes the starting Nurbssurface from the scene for having a view focused only on the generated
                    structure or he decides to start a new design approach, resets the geometry generation and modifies the surface again.
